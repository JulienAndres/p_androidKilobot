	title = {Kilobot: {A} low cost scalable robot system for collective behaviors},
	shorttitle = {Kilobot},
	abstract = {In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only \$14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.},

	title = {Probabilistic aggregation strategies in swarm robotic systems},
	abstract = {In this study, a systematic analysis of probabilistic aggregation strategies in swarm robotic systems is presented. A generic aggregation behavior is proposed as a combination of four basic behaviors: obstacle avoidance, approach, repel, and wait. The latter three basic behaviors are combined using a three-state finite state machine with two probabilistic transitions among them. Two different metrics were used to compare performance of strategies. Through systematic experiments, how the aggregation performance, as measured by these two metrics, change 1) with transition probabilities, 2) with number of simulation steps, and 3) with arena size, is studied.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of deploying a mobile sensor network in an unknown environment. A mobile sensor network is composed of a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. Such networks are capable of self-deployment; i.e., starting from some compact initial conﬁguration, the nodes in the network can spread out such that the area ‘covered’ by the network is maximized. In this paper, we present a potential-ﬁeld-based approach to deployment. The ﬁelds are constructed such that each node is repelled by both obstacles and by other nodes, thereby forcing the network to spread itself throughout the environment. The approach is both distributed and scalable.},

	shorttitle = {Behavioral {Specialization} in {Embodied} {Evolutionary} {Robotics}},
	abstract = {Embodied evolutionary robotics is an on-line distributed learning method used in collective robotics where robots are facing open environments. This paper focuses on learning behavioural specialization, as defined by robots being able to demonstrate different kind of behaviours at the same time (e.g. division of labour). Using a foraging task with two resources available in limited quantities, we show that behavioural specialization is unlikely to evolve in the general case, unless very specific conditions are met regarding interactions between robots (a very sparse communication network is required) and the expected outcome of specialization (specialization into groups of similar sizes is easier to achieve). We also show that the population size (the larger the better) as well as the selection scheme used (favoring exploration over exploitation) both play important -- though not always mandatory -- roles. This research sheds light on why existing embodied evolution algorithms are limited with respect to learning efficient division of labour in the general case, ie. where it is not possible to guess before deployment if behavioural specialization is required or not, and gives directions to overcome current limitations.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with a ﬁxed-size population of autonomous agents facing unknown, possibly changing, environments. The motivation is to design an embodied evolutionary algorithm that can cope with the implicit ﬁtness function hidden in the environment so as to provide adaptation in the long run at the level of the population. The proposed algorithm, termed mEDEA, is shown to be both efﬁcient in unknown environment and robust with regards to abrupt, unpredicted, and possibly lethal changes in the environment.},
